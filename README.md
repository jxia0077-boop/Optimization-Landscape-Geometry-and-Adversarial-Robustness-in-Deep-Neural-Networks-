# Optimization Landscape Geometry and Adversarial Robustness in Deep Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation and experimental results for my research on deep learning optimization and robustness.

## Key Features
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Implementation of **SAM (Sharpness-Aware Minimization)** from scratch to explore loss landscape geometry.
- **Adversarial Defense**: Robustness evaluation using **FGSM** and **PGD** attacks, mitigated via Adversarial Training.
- **Generalization**: Application of **Mixup** and **CutMix** regularization techniques.

## Results
- Achieved **97.14%** accuracy on the test set.
- Successfully outperformed baseline models in the cohort competition.

## Technologies
- PyTorch, Python, NumPy
- Optimization Theory, Adversarial Machine Learning
